- **Thumbnail grid** — responsive grid with three size options (S / M / L)
- **Lightbox viewer** — click any image to view full-size with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Esc)
- **Directory browsing** — navigate into subdirectories with breadcrumb navigation
- **Sorting** — sort by name or date (ascending/descending)
